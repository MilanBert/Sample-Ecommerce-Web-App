# JSP Web Development Learning Project

This repository contains a project developed as classwork for **COSC 304: Introduction to Databases**. The project served as an introduction to building web applications using Java Server Pages (JSP), integrating databases, and using Docker for deployment. Some of the code was provided as a template to guide the learning process.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Web Pages:** Implementation of JSP files for functionalities such as user authentication, shopping cart management, order processing, and administrative tasks.
- **Database Integration:** SQL scripts for defining and managing database schemas, such as order and product databases.
- **Docker Integration:** Use of a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to set up a containerized environment for easier deployment and reproducibility.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with JSP and web application development.
- Work with relational databases and understand their integration with web applications.
- Learn the basics of containerization using Docker.

This project was designed to provide a foundation in web development and database interaction, making it ideal for beginners. Feel free to explore the repository and adapt it for your learning journey. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
